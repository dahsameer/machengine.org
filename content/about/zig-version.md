# Zig version

Mach [nominates new Zig versions](../nominated-zig) periodically, these are **specific Zig nightly versions** and what Mach is built and tested against. Other versions, such as stable or latest-nightly releases, are usually incompatible.

## Mach nightly

_We encourage using Mach nightly (`main`, rather than a tagged release) for now._

Mach nightly is compatible with [Zig 2024.1.0-mach](/about/nominated-zig/#202410-mach)

## Version history

### Mach v0.2

Mach v0.2 is compatible with Zig v0.11. This was just by coincidence.
