    We’re planning a fully-fledged set of deeply integrated tools, a proper editor, the whole deal-we’re not kidding around here.

    Mach engine is not ready for use yet and is in the early-stages of development. We're realistic in that we are a fair amount of time away from this being reality - so please wait to hear our voice and <a href="roadmap">see the roadmap</a> for a general idea of what we're up to today.

## Deeply rooted in modularity

Mach engine is designed to be modular, the only part you must adopt is our Entity Component System (as all modules are built using this to integrate with one another.)

All modules will be optional, so that you can easily plug-and-play different ones for making GUIs, rendering 2D sprites, 3D meshes, physics & more.

## Data & tooling-driven

We envision a new set of tools for gamedevs that involve a deep integration with our ECS, which should allow for extensive debugging facilities and more. We're optimistic about exploring other tooling which effectively produce data in simple & intuitive ways (think: why is developing games not as fun as playing them?)

## Roadmap

There is a _long_ road ahead, it's going to require a lot of work to get to where we are going.

We've been working on Mach for ~2 years now, primarily building out the Zig gamedev ecosystem and building [foundational packages](../pkg) that we needed for [Mach core](../core), as a result we've really _just_ broken ground on the engine side of things.

[See the roadmap](roadmap) for a general idea of what we're up to today.
